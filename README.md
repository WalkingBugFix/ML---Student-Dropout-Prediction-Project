# ML---Student-Dropout-Prediction-Project
Dataset Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/697/predict+students+dropout+and+academic+success

This dataset was collected from a higher education institution and contains information on students enrolled in various undergraduate programs, including agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social work, and technology. The data was compiled from multiple sources and includes details available at the time of enrollment, such as academic history, demographic information, and socio-economic background, along with academic performance after the first and second semesters.

The goal is to use this information to develop classification models that can predict student outcomes—specifically whether a student will drop out, remain enrolled, or graduate—by the end of the standard course duration. The classification task involves three categories and is notably imbalanced, with one class being significantly more common.

This work is part of a broader project aimed at reducing dropout rates and improving academic success in higher education. By identifying students at risk early in their academic journey through machine learning techniques, institutions can implement targeted support strategies.
